# Wiki
This is my implementation of Harvard's CS50 Web project 1. It is a website similar to Wikipedia where users can look up and edit existing entries as well as add new ones. 
## Concepts acquired:
* First project utilising Django on the back end.
* Gained a deeper understanding of the basic HTTP actions (GET, POST).
* Utilised Django's form management system.
* Utilised markup language extensively.
